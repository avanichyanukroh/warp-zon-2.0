## Motivation

Tired of playing the same game or simply just looking for a great video game to gift? It's a lot of work to keep searching different sites to figure out which video game is the right one for you or the person you are buying it for. Sometimes after you find the right one, it was just simply out of your budget range. This gave me the idea to create a simple and effortless application that combines both aspects of video game and price comparison research.
